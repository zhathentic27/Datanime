To most people, the ban of butter in French toast preparation might come as a surprise or even shock. But I'm not most people.

As such, our French toast, along with any other sauteing endeavors, were prepared using oil.
I've had French toast numerous times and wanted try a different approach today. And that is when pineapple sage-scented challah French toast was born. Welcome to the world! I hope you have a long, successful life.

This classic salad dressing includes mayonnaise, anchovies, vinegar, green onion, garlic, parsley, tarragon and chives. It can be prepared in a blender or food processor and is good served as a dressing for steamed artichokes, a seafood salad, or as a sauce over broiled fish. (If you don't have fresh tarragon, you can use 1/4 teaspoon dried, instead.)

CALYPSO BARS
A chocolate date bar. My childhood memories of holidays included these bars from my mother's friend Bernie. Wonderfully rich.

SUMMER HERB PESTO
A fresh tasty pesto you can make with herbs right from the garden. Delicious tossed with pasta, spread on a sandwich, or as a dip for veggies. Pesto will keep stored in an airtight container and refrigerated for up to one week. It can also be frozen and stored for up to a month.

DOWN HOME BAKED BEANS
This is a simple recipe for baked beans, and oh so good.

This is an easy and very nice tasting desert. It goes well after a heavy meal or when you want something slightly sweet.

MAPLE WALNUT MUFFINS
Yummy! Try these tasty walnut muffins for breakfast with a hot cup of coffee or tea.

BAKE SALE CHOCOLATE CHIP OATMEAL BROWNIES
The recipe for these moist, delicious brownies has been in my family for as long as I can remember. It is a winner with everyone and is a great bake sale item. At a recent sale, one man came back twice and then sent his son for more!

MASCARPONE
Mascarpone cheese is great but can be hard to find. Learn how to make mascarpone at home with this simple recipe. It isn't 100% authentic (authentic recipes use a bacterial culture), but it doesn't require any hard-to-find ingredients, either!

HOW LEMONS HELP ME STAY CONNECTED TO MY MOTHER'S SYRIAN FAMILY AND CULTURE
Whether in a wedge or added to recipes in juice, lemons are an anchor in Arab cooking.

INSTANT POT BEEF-STUFFED PEPPERS
Since today's electric pressure cookers are so versatile, you can make versatile recipes in them such as these stuffed bell peppers. Top your bell peppers with your favorite garnish, such as pico de gallo. The stuffing can also be used for taco salads as well as tacos or burritos.

AIR FRYER HONEYNUT SQUASH
Honeynut squashes are the tiny brown squashes that look kind of like miniature butternut squashes. The flesh is a bit darker and very sweet. This simple preparation is easy, delicious, and makes a fun presentation for dinner guests on Thanksgiving or for any fall or winter meal. I made mine in my Ninja® Foodi™ digital air fryer, and my instructions are rather specific for that configuration. Adapt accordingly for your oven or air fryer, which also may need to be preheated (the Ninja® Foodi™ heats so fast that no preheating is needed).

CHEESY POTATO CASSEROLE FROM ORE-IDA
This cheesy potato casserole with lots of shredded hash browns and a crispy topping couldn't be easier to make. Serve either as a main dish for everyday comfort food, or a creamy, classic holiday side. Garnish with additional sliced green onions if desired.

CHICKEN PARMESAN CASSEROLE
This easy canned chicken casserole is a delicious alternative to homemade chicken Parmesan.

SUGAR-FREE CAKE
This sugar-free cake is really good, with the added plus of no sugar.

This is the best carrot cake recipe I have ever made! It's so moist and flavorful and makes a large quantity of cake. Since I started making it, I have been hounded to make this cake time and time again. Frost with cream cheese frosting.

BEST APPLE PIE
Lemon juice gives this pie some added zing!

THAI-STYLE TURKEY BURGERS
Turkey burgers with coriander, ginger, and garlic to give a Thai flavor. This recipe can easily be made gluten free by using gluten-free soy sauce and breadcrumbs. Can be served alone, or on a gluten-free or whole wheat bun.

POSH FISH FINGERS
Fish fingers with a twist! I first learned how to bread fish at the Hotel St. George in Harrogate. You could serve them with chips and tell them it's the best fish and chips you can get outside Yorkshire.

FRIED PUMPKIN
Use that extra pumpkin to make a rich and buttery side dish with a delicious crusty coating.

SIMPLE BROCCOLINI
This quick broccolini dish is delicious, good for you, and full of garlicky, lemony flavor. Broccolini is more tender than broccoli and has a milder flavor. I love the mix of textures; the crunchy stems and the softer florets that soak up sauce are a great combination.

BOOK CLUB BLACKBERRY COBBLER
All of the Southern women in my book club love to eat. Each month we choose a potluck theme. The theme this month was 'Soul Food Throw Down.' Our dessert this month was blackberry cobbler. This is an easy recipe that uses canned blackberries. It's best with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream.

CREAM CHEESE BANANA BREAD
Banana bread with cream cheese filling.

QUICK OYAKODON
This dish is very easy to make and very Japanese. It reminds me of dishes I've ordered in Japanese restaurants. You can add Korean hot sauce if you like it a little spicy.

COSTCO HAS A STANLEY TUMBLER LOOK-ALIKE FOR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE
And, it's spill-proof.

FRUIT AND BROCCOLI BUFFET SALAD
Another great salad for your next family fun night.

GRANDMA'S CHEESY POTATOES
My grandmother makes this every year with a brisket for Christmas dinner. This is hands down my favorite potato recipe ever. I leave the skins on the potatoes, but this is optional. Garnish with chopped green onions or Italian parsley, and top with more cheese for a restaurant 'look.' I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we do.

PEACH SUMMER COBBLER
I couldn't find a cobbler recipe that was exactly what I was looking for, so I threw this together. This is my first submitted recipe, so please be kind when ripping it to shreds!

TILAPIA WITH GREEN TOMATO TAPENADE
The tapenade is great in pasta, served as an appetizer on bread rounds, or over another mild fish or thin chicken breast. It's a great way to use up your green tomatoes at the end of the season. You can also make a big batch and freeze it. It is a nice taste of late summer when it's cold out. I do have to say, I think this is good enough; I am looking forward to summer's first tomatoes that might just not get a chance to ripen!

TEX-MEX TUNA SALAD
This is a great recipe for tuna fish tacos.

SIMPLE CHICKEN PARMESAN
This chicken Parmesan pasta is the perfect, simple dish to lure kids into the kitchen — what kid doesn't like chicken tenders and spaghetti? This dish is loaded with mini cooking lessons, too. With one simple recipe, kids learn how to boil pasta, mince garlic, grate cheese, make tomato sauce, and pound, bread, and sauté cutlets. Bonus: This recipe makes twice the sauce needed, so freeze half for another meal.

CHOCOLATE MINT PIE
This pie has a chocolate cookie crust and an ice cream filling, but the creme de menthe meringue topping is what makes it special. It is a perfect St. Patrick's Day treat. Vanilla ice cream can be substituted for the mint chocolate chip.

THIS BRILLIANT HACK IS THE EASIEST WAY TO REMOVE BAKED-ON FOOD
Zero elbow grease required!

HOMEMADE ENERGY BARS
These are the ultimate homemade energy bars — they're absolutely delicious! Make them if you want more fiber in your diet and you're sick of feeding the kids those boxed, dry, bland granola bars.

MONGOLIAN CHICKEN
If Mongolian beef is your go to when it comes to Chinese take-out, I challenge you to try this version made with chicken instead. The chicken is melt-in-your-mouth tender and requires no marinating time as beef would. Serve over rice.

HEARTY CHICKEN VEGETABLE SOUP I
This thick and hearty chicken soup makes a great meal on those cold winter days. Try different types of pasta like bow ties, elbow macaroni, shells, rotini, spiral etc. This soup can not be beat when served with fresh thick sliced bread on the side!!

MEXICAN PIZZA
This Mexican pizza recipe layers delicious seasoned ground beef and refried beans between two crisp tortillas. Top with salsa, cheese, tomatoes, and jalapeño for incredible flavor in every bite!

RAGÚ NO-FRYING EGGPLANT PARMESAN
This no-fry eggplant parmesan is made with breaded eggplant slices, baked then layered with lots of cheese and sauce for a delicious family-favorite dinner.

CRAN-APPLE-PEAR SAUCE
A blend of whole berry cranberry sauce, apple pie filling, and sliced pears. Perfect for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Goes great with ham, turkey or chicken. Yum! Simple but delicious -- you'll get many compliments. Just don't tell anyone how easy it was! This makes a lot. You can halve it, but will end up with 1/2 a can of apple pie filling. (Although, it probably wouldn't hurt to put in the entire can.)

HOW TO PREVENT YOUR ICE CREAM FROM GETTING FREEZER BURN

AIR FRYER CORNED BEEF HASH
This crispy corned beef hash is made in the air fryer from start to finish. It's great if you're looking for something to do with leftover corned beef.

PANNEKAKEN (NORWEGIAN PANCAKES)
My Norwegian grandmother made these pancakes for us as a treat, and they continue to be a favorite when my mother makes them for my kids. They're very easy and versatile — serve them rolled like crêpes with syrup or jam. Or serve them for dessert stuffed with sweetened cream cheese and lingonberry jam.

YOYO'S BBQ BEANS
This is a barbecued bean recipe I came up with on a whim thinking it would taste good. As it turns out, it tasted great!! My boyfriend ate more beans than BBQ!

My family loves these stuffed sandwiches. Easy for entertaining makes enough for a crowd.

CHOCOLATE PUDDING SHOTS
Chocolate pudding shots are an awesome alternative to Jell-O shots. Serve them in individual serving cups with plastic spoons.

BAKED BUTTERNUT SQUASH WITH GARLIC AND CHEESE
Garlic complements the sweetness of the butternut squash very well. This is a great side or vegetarian main dish from the oven. If you cut the squash into small pieces, it will cut down on the cooking time as well.

IF YOU'RE STILL CUTTING CAULIFLOWER INTO FLORETS, YOU'RE DOING IT ALL WRONG
This trick will give you the crispiest roasted cauliflower ever.

HIGHLAND TOFFEE
Sweet and chewy oatmeal base covered in a layer of chocolate and nuts. Irresistible.

THAI-STYLE RICE SALAD
This recipe occurred semi-accidentally. I was studying various Thai recipes and examining the flavors, and went home to stare at my fridge, and out came this recipe. A wonderful condiment to eat with this dish, and many other asian dishes, is Sambal Oelek, a garlic-chili paste you can find in the asian section of most groceries and asian specialty stores. It's quite spicy, and quite tasty.

FROG EYE SALAD
This frog eye salad is made with acini di pepe (or couscous) pasta, coconut, pineapple, mandarin oranges, and marshmallows for a sweet, chilled dessert.

AIR FRYER RED POTATOES
A few simple ingredients and the air fryer will turn these baby potatoes into a comforting side dish. They're suitable for any time of year, especially those hot summer days when you don't want to heat up the oven. I like to use mini potatoes that are between 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter.

NANA'S 7-LAYER SALAD
This colorful 7-layer salad has made numerous appearances at our family gatherings over the years. My Nana has no shortage of delicious recipes from appetizers to desserts that she has passed down to me since I began cooking. This salad is not only yummy, but it's so quick and easy to prepare and definitely one of my all-time favorites!

WHOLE WHEAT PUMPKIN BREAD
Nicely spiced with cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg, this whole wheat pumpkin bread is moist and delicious! Makes one loaf or 18 muffins.

Ham, cabbage, and potatoes are simmered over low heat in one skillet and seasoned with paprika; tasty and satisfying.

CHEWY WHOLE WHEAT PEANUT BUTTER BROWNIES
These are a great take on the Peanut Butter Brownie. You can't tell the difference between whole wheat and regular flour. My family eats them up EVERY TIME I bake them.

VENISON STEAK WITH PEPPERS AND ONIONS
This steak, peppers, and onions dish is my brother's recipe. I've always been loathe to eat food made with venison, which I call Bambi, but I couldn't resist the smell of this delicious meal. My brother brings this out at football watching parties, but denies it is venison until after the taste test. Serve with rice or noodles.

DONATIONS TO DINERS AND FREE STARBUCKS: HERE ARE JUST SOME OF THE GOOD NEWS HEADLINES WE LOVE THIS WEEK

LEMON-PEPPER CHICKEN AND POTATOES
Chicken breast and potatoes topped with lemon-pepper seasoning and diced bell peppers and onions.

Decadent Alfredo sauce mixed in with spaghetti squash and chicken. I am not a girl who likes to eat veggies and I found this to be delicious!

This pineapple angel food cake requires just three easy ingredients: cake mix, canned pineapple, and whipped topping.

MINI WAFFLE POPS WITH WHITE CHOCOLATE, COCONUT, AND CANDIED GINGER

The reviews are in -- everyone is raving about this fabulously easy pumpkin pie.

A true Southern delicacy. This recipe comes from the peanut capital of the world: Sylvester, Georgia. Passed down through generations, this is sure crowd pleaser. Straight from momma's kitchen.

TANGY PESTO POTATO SALAD
A wonderfully tangy potato salad. Perfect with burgers or other grilled foods.

NO-CHURN LEMON-BASIL SORBET
Sweet, tart, and refreshing, this lemon sorbet with a touch of basil is the perfect ending to a meal! You can make this without an ice cream freezer, just allow plenty of time for it to freeze.

HALLOUMI SKEWERS WITH TAHINI SAUCE AND DUKKAH
Marinated halloumi cheese and veggies are grilled, then topped with tahini sauce and dukkah.

PINEAPPLE STUFFING
This pineapple stuffing makes a great side with ham. I often make this dish for the holidays.

PUMPKIN SHORTBREAD COOKIES
This is a spicy, pumpkiny variation of shortbread cookies. The added pumpkin makes them slightly softer than your average shortbread, but they've got a pleasant texture nonetheless. Make these ahead of time--they taste better the next day. Store in an airtight container.

SOUTHERN TOMATO PIE
Tomato slices are juicy and mix in well with the creamy/cheesy "custard" in this Southern-inspired tomato pie. The blind baking method helps keep the crust nice and crunchy on the bottom.

BOILED CABBAGE WITH BACON
Very tender, very flavorful vegetable side. Based on this recipe, seems like Army cooks don't think much of cabbage.

INSTANT POT® VEGETARIAN WHITE "CHICKEN" CHILI
This is a great vegetarian Instant Pot® recipe (or even vegan, if you change out a few ingredients) for traditional white chicken chili. This is not a very spicy chili if made according to this recipe, but you could up the game by adding more jalapenos or peppers of your choice.

COUSCOUS PILAF WITH ALMONDS, COCONUT, AND CRANBERRIES
Wake up your couscous pilaf with a delicious blend of almonds, coconut, and dried cranberries.

Outside of an Oriental restaurant, this is one of the best!

WHITE CHOCOLATE-LIME MUFFINS
Yummy cake-like muffins, with lime and white chocolate. These are closer to tart than sweet--not sour, but a nice change from very sweet desserts.

MASCARPONE STUFFED FRENCH TOAST WITH PEACHES
Lemon zest and mascarpone stuffed into thick white bread slices, dipped in batter, pan fried, and smothered in fresh peach sauce. I love this recipe for breakfast but it could be fancy enough for dessert too.

POACHED PEARS
The ultimate in class and taste. Serve with sweetened whipped cream flavored with vanilla and Grand Marnier.

INSTANT POT® INFUSED OLIVE OIL
Infuse 3 different flavors of olive oil at the same time and in one pot. Use in salad dressings, pasta, rice, fish, or anything you like. Making popcorn is my favorite way to use the crushed red pepper oil. Refrigerate oils for up to 10 days. Bring to room temperature before using.

CHEF JOHN'S DRUNKEN NOODLES
I did have a drink or three while making these, so I could enjoy them as the food gods intended, which is slightly drunk. At least that's the main theory on how this dish got its name. The other theory is that it got its name because at one point it was made with wine — but that's not as entertaining! Serve garnished with Thai basil and lime, if desired.

FIRE-ROASTED CORN AND BEEF SKILLET PIE
This zesty take on a comforting pot pie gets a spicy kick with pepper Jack cheese. Have some pizza seasoning in your spice cabinet? Sprinkle it over the breadsticks before baking.

CAMPBELL'S® SLOW-COOKER CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS
The slow-cooker simmers chicken, potatoes, carrots, and celery in a creamy sauce made with Campbell's® Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup, to be topped with tender dumplings made easy with baking mix.

SLOW COOKER TURKEY AND CHORIZO CHILI
This is the turkey chili I made to compete on fooduel.blogspot.com. It's not overbearingly spicy, with good texture and flavor. To thicken this chili, you can add double the amount of chorizo and stew the tomato sauce before adding it to the slow cooker.

NATILLAS (MEXICAN CUSTARD)
Mexican custard-type dessert that is so light you can't eat just one. This recipe has been in my family for over 130 years. Most of these ingredients are probably already in your pantry and it can be whipped up and put in the refrigerator for tomorrow's dinner party.

BLACK FOREST CAKE ICING
This frosting recipe is great with Black Forest cake or any other cake. Pair this icing with cherry pie filling and your favorite chocolate cake for a delicious Black Forest cake.

CHICKEN HURRY
This is a quick and easy dish to make. Great for potlucks, family dinners, or cold the next day with salad for a picnic. This sauce is also great on pork spare ribs. Serve hot with rice and salad.

WHITE CHOCOLATE GINGERSNAPS
My disdain for improperly used white chocolate is, I think, pretty well known, so one of my favorite holiday cookies might surprise you! It's one of the cookies in my Charm City Cakes Christmas cookie tins this year. It's a chewy-centered gingersnap cookie drizzled with white chocolate and chopped candied ginger. What's wonderful about these cookies is that you get a crackly texture from the candied ginger and the outside of the cookie as well as a soft, mushy texture from the inside of the cookie. You also get a sweet creaminess from the white chocolate that tempers the sharpness of the ginger. My philosophy is, when you use ginger, use it!

QUICK PICKLED JALAPEÑO RINGS
These pickled jalapeños are easy to make and a no-brainer topping for your nachos, but the fun doesn't stop there. Use them to make any sandwich more special and any salad less snoozy.

CREAMY TORTELLINI SOUP
Broccoli cheese soup is elevated with the addition of cheese tortellini for a cozy fall soup. The best part, it's ready in 30 minutes!

SPICY AVOCADO CHICKEN

VEGAN MUSHROOM GRAVY
This quick-and-easy vegan mushroom gravy is rich, thick, and creamy but made without using any dairy! Simply delicious with mashed potatoes.

This corn and poblano casserole is a great addition to your Thanksgiving table. This simple recipe transforms frozen corn into a decadent, richly flavored dish in no time at all.

Over a decade working in corporate America, Uzo Orimalade switched careers to pay homage to her mother and share dishes that have a touch of her African heritage.

GRANDMA'S HONG SHAU ROU (RED BRAISED PORK)
I have been reading about this traditional Chinese dish on the Internet and found there are many different versions of it. Some are spicy, incorporating chile and ginger. Others have the spices of star anise, cinnamon, and lots of garlic added too. The recipe my grandma passed on to us here is the garlicky one.
Garnish with some chopped spring onions or cilantro and serve with steamed white rice or buns. I like to serve a side dish of pickled cucumber slices with the pork and this tanginess brings another dimension to the dish. Chi Fan (time to eat)!

SINIGANG NA BAKA
Simple beef, vegetable, tamarind based soup that we eat over rice! A meal in itself!

TOMATO, CUCUMBER AND RED ONION SALAD WITH MINT
Refreshing light summer salad.

A sourdough spiced coffee cake, also known as an Amish Friendship Cake.

FAT SAM'S MEATY MELTED MAN DIP - IS IT FOOTBALL SEASON, YET???
A quick, spicy sausage cheese dip. This isn't tea party food, nothing dainty or low-fat about it. This is an appetizer that eats like a MEAL and it keeps guests coming back to the bowl. You may have to work out twice to make up for it, but you'll be happy you did! Best served hot with plenty of tortilla chips.

EARL GREY CREAM PIE
Aunt Kitty used to make this Earl Grey cream pie for her famous tea parties. Sometimes she would finish it with orange zest on top of the whipped cream just to gild the lily.

A sweet brown rice treat that I created one day after running out of white rice. Garnish with nutmeg and some optional raw vanilla sticks. Hope that you enjoy it!

PLANT-BASED TOMATO TART
A vegan version of heirloom tomato pie. It uses cashews and chickpeas as a fluffy filling, then it's topped with fresh summer tomatoes and jalapenos for a kick. Use an olive oil brisee for a crisp, light, and healthy touch.

GLUTEN-FREE SOURDOUGH STARTER
This is a step-by-step guide on how to begin a gluten-free sourdough starter without yeast. The amounts here are for getting the mother dough started. You will need to keep extra flour mix on-hand to continue feeding as long as you want to keep the starter. Once it begins to have a sponge-like consistency, it is ready to use and should be kept in the fridge or else it will grow wild all over the counter. Add a bit of the starter in your favorite recipes calling for yeast or baking powder for a unique flavor and texture.

VEGETARIAN DECONSTRUCTED PEPPERS
I took the traditional stuffed peppers and deconstructed it and gave it a twist with taco seasoning and made it vegetarian by using Beyond Meat® substitute. If desired you can go completely vegan by swapping out the cheese and sour cream for dairy-free substitutes.

SPOOKY WITCHES' FINGERS
I made these witches' fingers using a traditional cookie recipe that we have had in our family for years. All I did was change the shape to make them look like fingers for our annual Halloween party. The cookies make a great conversation piece. My guests loved them!

CHOCOLATE CHIP HONEY COOKIES
My grandmother would send a huge box of cookies and candies to us every Christmas when I was a child. She always included these cookies because they were my dad's favorite (mine too). I am allergic to walnuts so if I decide to add nuts I use almonds. Now my daughter and I enjoy making them together.

CANDIED SWEET POTATOES WITH ORANGE JUICE
Every holiday my mother makes these candied sweet potatoes with orange juice and every holiday someone asks for her recipe. After 53 years, she certainly has perfected it!

FRESH PANKO

A delicious bun-less grilled turkey burger infused with summer peaches, jalapeno, and onions and served over mixed greens with endive, bacon, avocado, gorgonzola, and some more peaches. I created this recipe for my blog, Celiac and Allergy Friendly Epicurean by Jackie Ourman, however, it is a fantastic meal for all and does not need to be made gluten free. You can just use regular soy and teriyaki sauces. Toss salad with mustard vinaigrette if you like.

ROASTED POTATOES WITH GREENS
Roasted potatoes mingle with fresh spinach in a sauce of garlic, butter, sea salt and fresh rosemary. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and/or a good shredded hard cheese like Parmesan or Pecorino if you like.

RUTH'S GRANDMA'S PIE CRUST
This recipe is over 100 years old. My sister-in-law's grandmother said it was a no-fail recipe. It's the best I ever had.

CHEF JOHN'S GRILLED LAMB STEAKS
Using vinaigrette as a sauce for grilled meats is one of my favorite 'cheats' of all time. They take minutes to whisk together, there's absolutely no culinary finesse required, and the combinations of oils, vinegar, and flavorings are limitless. How about balsamic vinaigrette on some grilled skirt steak? Maybe mustard dressing on some pork chops? How could grilled chicken drizzled with Greek dressing and feta cheese not be awesome?

THE BEST EASY PORK TENDERLOIN 
This pork tenderloin is super rich and buttery. The end product is incredibly moist and tender. The pan drippings make the most delicious light sauce with richness from the meat juices and acidity and flavor from the wine and seasonings.

PEPPERONI MEATZA
For people that are gluten-intolerant, low-carb, paleo, or whatever, it can be hard to go without pizza. This dish makes it a lot easier. It is made pretty much exactly the same as pizza, but with ground beef as the crust. Sounds weird at first, but it is absolutely delicious and very filling. This is something great to make ahead of time and then eat as leftovers later on. It's great hot or cold, just like pizza! I find that if you make 6 square slices, each slice is usually more than enough to fill you up.
Feel free to add whatever toppings you normally eat on pizza. It will taste just as good!

MEXICO CHIQUITO PUNCH
This copycat punch recipe is as close as you can get to the punch served at the Mexico Chiquito fast-food chain in Little Rock, Arkansas. Their punch is hands down the best tropical fruit punch ever.

BEST NO-BEAN CHILI
Perfect for people who love using their slow cookers. I've tried many chili recipes but this one is the best ever! You can substitute beans for the cornmeal, but I think it takes away from the taste and the smooth texture. I recommend opening a second bottle of porter beer and drink it while cooking this tasty dish! Yum!

MACARONS (FRENCH MACAROONS)
Macarons are made with finely ground almonds, confectioners' sugar, and egg whites. They are the most delicious soft cookies with crispy edges. I finally perfected the technique and wanted to share it. Pipe your choice of filling or frosting on a cookie and sandwich another cookie on top. 

VIETNAMESE/CHINESE PORK CHOPS
My mom and I developed this recipe together. We call it Vietnamese/Chinese because the fish sauce is from Vietnamese cuisine and 5 spice powder from Chinese cuisine. It is our favorite marinade for pork chops. If you buy your pork chops from an Asian market, let them know what you're cooking. Generally, the thinner the chop, the better.

BLT PASTA SALAD

HAM BONE AND VEGETABLE SOUP
I was looking for a good use of a ham bone without the heavy cream of a potato soup. I made use of a few other recipes to come up with one that I thought my husband and I would like.

In addition, you can add a variety of different vegetables to suit your taste or depending on what you have in the house at the time.

This olive oil-based rosemary seasoning is great on chicken or pork, particularly when using an indirect grilling method. You can also use this on potatoes.

The crust on the tofu sticks is tasty and the texture is really wonderful. Serve with a relish or a dip of some sort (I love this with plain yogurt mixed with eggplant brinjal). I usually make this with a cumin-scented rice dish and a garlicky broccoli side.

POUND CAKE WITH COCONUT OIL

Salad dressing as you will see is very easy and is so delicious and light. Add fresh garlic bread or breadsticks and a glass of wine (Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc). The combination of the citrus dressing and the fruit and dill proves to be a delicious marriage of fruit and herbs. Enjoy.

SAILOR'S STEW
This is a hearty beef stew using beer and beef broth as its base. It's very yummy and I've never had any complaints about it. If you use older potatoes in this recipe they will break down better during cooking and thicken the sauce.

Prickly pears make a uniquely flavorful and pretty pink jam. After reading that prickly pears are covered with barely visible spines, I was a bit shaky.
